# Sleepover
Sleepover is a hackathon project created by a team of 4 at PenApps XVI using React Native and Expo.io.

# Idea
Sleepover is an iOS app that helps you set tasks for you and your close friends. For example, you can get your friend to "wake you up tomorrow" by assigning a friend in the Sleepover app and setting a date/time. Sleepover has a custom approach to ensure mutual accountability and is meant to automate the process of "grey areas" when you "oversleep". The same concept can be applied to any kind of mutual safety net that concerns groups of friends who want to look out for each other: a) ensuring your friend's safety when they are travelling alone, b) making sure that your friend remembers to do a task, the list goes on.
